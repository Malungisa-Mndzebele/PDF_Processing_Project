December, 2002

Jeffrey,

You could never imagine the surprise | felt when Ghislaine first contacted me about writing something for your
memory book.

Over the years I have thought of Class 5-3 & 6-3, numerous times with affection and really fond memories. After all,
you guys were my second class EVER and [ had just transferred from my first job, which was in, of all places, Fort
Apache, The Bronx! Imagine, coming from a class of hold-overs, delinquents, and worse, to a class of “Intellectually
Gifted Children.” Believe me, it was quite a chore just to keep one step ahead of that class.

One day, about 2 weeks ago, ! was on the Norther State Parkway on my way home, creeping along at § miles an
hour, in the midst of a snowstorm, when my cell phone rang, | spent the next 15 minutes or so reliving the past with
Warren, who was calling from sunny Dallas, Texas. As we talked and he mentioned students’ names, most of the
faces flashed before my eyes. I even told him.... Jeffrey, saxophone, Michael, clarinet, Warren, saxophone and so on
for most of the class. He later sent me a picture of the class and there | was, much thinner, with black horn-rimmed
glasses and a full head of dark brown hair. There you were, just as I remembered you, with a Mona Lisa smile that
hid what was really going on in that interesting brain of yours. Who could have guessed the wonderful, fascinating
things that were in store for you?

I remember discussing Abraham Lincoln with the class and staring in wonder at the student who had read all of
Sandberg’s Life of Lincoln and spouted facts of which | was totally unaware. | also remember my math (never my
strong suit) being corrected from time to time, very respectfully, by Jeffrey. I also remember the Coney Island
Cleanup Parade and performing onstage at Lafayette and blowing away the audience who had just listened to a
Junior High orchestra.

I have many awards and plaques on my office wails, at home and at work.... too many for any one place, but for all
these years | stiil treasure and display the gold painted, wooden plaque that I received from your class for being the
“Best Teacher.”

I’m thrilled and delighted that you still remember me and that in some small way I may have made a difference and
touched your life. Happy Birthday!

In 1963, you were around 10 and I was 23.... twice as old as you. Today you are 50 and I’m 63.,.. somehow you’re

catching up! How did that happen?

Dearest Jeffrey,

if | were to list my life time achievements, surely scoring higher than you on the nineth
grade algebra regent would rank in the top ten. I'll never forget the exhilaration of
considering myself smarter than Jeffrey Epstein in math. That same year, you not only
performed mathematical magic by tutoring me to get a perfect score on the regent,
you thrilled our class in music by playing "California Dreaming" on the piano, and thrilled
me even more by stealing a kiss after "The Sound of Music" at Radio City Music Hall.

When we met again some time after college, you had shoulder length curls, wore
wonderful hand-embroidered denim work shirts and tight jeans, and drove a brown
Camaro with a glove compartment full of parking tickets. Needless to say, you had
outgrown your shyness around girls and even confessed that you participated in peace
marches because they were the easiest places to get laid. A truly unique perspective
on political activism in the 70's.

A few years later during a trip to Palm Beach, we were driving around admiring the
homes when you pointed in the direction of a particularly impressive mansion and said,
"One day, I'm going to own that." | smiled and considered your comment nothing more
than wishful thinking. Many mansions later, you have shown me the importance of
having a vision and the determination to pursue it. A lesson | continue to rely upon for
inspiration.

From lessons in algebra to lessons in life, the lessons I've learned from you during the
past 35 years haven't always been easy or even ones that | would have chosen to learn,
but they were always important. I'm very grateful to have you for a friend and hope
that if you ever need help solving a rate/time/distance problem, you won't hesitate to
call.

All my love,
