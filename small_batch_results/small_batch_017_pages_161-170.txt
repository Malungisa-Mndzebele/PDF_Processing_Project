Who is that bum over there |
Why it’s Jeffrey, I declare |
The man of means
in sweat shirt and jeans |
At a black tie formal affair

To add to life’s piquancy

Jeffery, with increasing frequency.

on any occasion
with little persuasion,
Will outrage the public decency.

I have heard that Jeffrey will act
With morals, decorum and tact,
with honor, good will
and truth, but forsooth,
This information may be inexact.

As far as I can detect,
Jeffrey seems to select

To express his mood,

Terms rude, crude and lewd,
and politically incorrect.

Jeffrey at half a century,

with credentials plenipotentiary,
though up to no good
whenever he could,

has avoided the penitentiary. ~

The first equation is a fundamental property of the
Riemann zeta function (that it is both a sum over all
integers and a product over primes). The zeta function
is a very important function, and this equation partially
explains why people care about it (although this may not
be apparent from the equation :-): it encodes information

The first picture is a visualization of Euclid's proof of the
Pythagorean theorem. He wanted to show that the big square on
the hypotenuse had area exactly equal to those of the small squares
combined. To do this, he dropped a perpendicular line (the one in
the picture that cuts through the triangle and the big square) and

claimed that the two rectangles it divided the big square into had areas
equal to those of the small squares. To establish that, he showed

that all four shaded triangles had the same area (which is not too

hard using the 1/2-base-times-height area formula for triangles).

The structure of the proof is often obscured by using a single

diagram covered with letters labeling various things.

A 13-by-13 square is cut up into four pieces, which are reassembled
into an 8-by-21 rectangle. However 132 = 8*21 + 1. Where did the
missing unit of area go?
