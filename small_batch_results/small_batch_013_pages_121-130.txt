Dear Jeffrey,

As a birthday gift to you, I managed to obtain an early version of the Vanity Unfair
article. I talked them into changing the focus from you to Bill Clinton, as you will see
from the enclosed excerpt. Happy birthday and best regards.

Who Was That Man With Epstein?

Enquiring minds are asking, “Who was that man with Epstein?” Jeffrey Epstein is, of
course, one of the world’s most famous men, a household name throughout the planet. |
His picture has appeared on the cover of every magazine in the world. Everyone knows

his story - - from his humble roots on Coney Island to his rise as one of the most envied |
public figures of the western world. But what was he doing flying to Africa with an
obscure former politician from Hope, Arkansas? Who is that politician and why would
Epstein have picked him for the coveted seat on his private jet. Vanity Unfair was
determined to get to the bottom. of this mystery man and to reveal the story behind the
story. Normally we would not pry into the private life of an obscure Arkansas
politician, particularly one who has tried so hard, and up to now so successfully, to keep
his private life to himself, But the moment this obscure man stepped onto the Epstein
jet, he became fair game for probing enquiry. Why would a man like Epstein, who can
pick and choose his companions from princes to professors, select a flying companion
from the Ozark Mountains? To be sure, he was a Rhodes Scholar, but we all know how }
easy it is to get a Rhodes if you’re from Arkansas. There must be something else.
Vanity Unfair decided to snoop around, The obscure politician reluctantly agreed to an
interview, on the express condition that it was completely off the record. This is what
he told us...
