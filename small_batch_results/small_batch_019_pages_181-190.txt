The mathematics of life

Martin Nowak
Epstein Institute, Harvard University

The primordial soup, here or elsewhere, generated a
quasispecies of aperiodic macromolecules. Quasispecies
live in sequence space, which is a collection of hyper-
dimensional cubes. Each cybe arises by ordering all _
possible sequences of a certain length in such a way that
nearest neighbors differ in only one position. The length of
ifte genome determines the dimension of the cube. A very
small gene, for example, lives in a 1000 dimensional cube.
Its sequence is 1 particular choice out of 10® possibilities.

For comparison there are only 40° protons in our universe.

An alphabetis a finite list of symbols. Sentences are strings of symbols.
A language Is a set of sentences. A finite language has a finite number of
sentences. An infinite language has an infinite number of sentences. There
are infinitely many finite languages.

Human languages are infinite.

A grammar is a finite list of rules that generates a language. Grammars
are equivalent to computers. Finite state grammars generate regular
languages which are accepted by finite state machines. Phrase structure
grammars give rise to computable languages which are Turing complete.
For each such language there exists a Turing machine that accepts every
sentence that is part of the language, but may compute forever on
sentences that do not belong the language.

The language of mathematics is not computable.

Learning is selection among a restricted set of hypothocos.
Ambitious learners exceed their teachers.

There are six billion intellects on Earth, but this is
the quickest one I’ve met (aside from Isaac Asimov);
he sees things differently from all the rest, asks
questions that no one else ever asked, and suggests
answers that no one would ever expect.
