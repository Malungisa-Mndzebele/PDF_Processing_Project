Finally, at the home of our friend, let’s call him Mr. Brown, J effrey
unveiled his plan. To some it may have seemed a get-rich-quick scheme, but
to me it was pure genius: Rob and Kill was the name of the plan. The first
victim, a be attacked and brutally plundered ( would
she want more than that?) on the boardwalk in Venice Beach. Broad
daylight. The dastardly thieves were never caught.

Postscript: I retired from “the life”, but I recently read an article in New
York which led me to believe that my old friend Mr. E had continued on and

become an industry leader.

Jeffrey was such a nice man, a sweet, innocent type. One ot my employees
called him Mr. Epstein, the math teacher. Always ready to lend a hand, help
a friend in need. He even volunteered to help out in surgery at UCLA,
scrubbed, put on the gown, the whole bit, just to do his part.

Then, things began to change. I think it was shortly after he encouraged
Morgan to say “woof” on the phone to me that I noticed the beginning. And
then, while his friends were willing to either go blissfully ahead, eyes closed,
trusting in the Almighty, Jeffrey began to get that look in his eye. He was
cooking up something, something either evil or at least deadly. I always
hoped he wasn’t spurred to action by my action — the unforgivable, immortal
sin of getting married.
