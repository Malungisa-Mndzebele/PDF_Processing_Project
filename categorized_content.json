I'll never forget the exhilaration of\nconsidering myself smarter than Jeffrey Epstein in math. That same year, you not only\nperformed mathematical magic by tutoring me to get a perfect score on the regent,\nyou thrilled our class in music by playing \"California Dreaming\" on the piano, and thrilled\nme even more by stealing a kiss after \"The Sound of Music\" at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nWhen we met again some time after college, you had shoulder length curls, wore\nwonderful hand-embroidered denim work shirts and tight jeans, and drove a brown\nCamaro with a glove compartment full of parking tickets. Needless to say, you had\noutgrown your shyness around girls and even confessed that you participated in peace\nmarches because they were the easiest places to get laid. A truly unique perspective\non political activism in the 70's.\n\nA few years later during a trip to Palm Beach, we were driving around admiring the\nhomes when you pointed in the direction of a particularly impressive mansion and said,\n\"One day, I'm going to own that.\" | smiled and considered your comment nothing more\nthan wishful thinking. Many mansions later, you have shown me the importance of\nhaving a vision and the determination to pursue it. A lesson | continue to rely upon for\ninspiration.\n\nFrom lessons in algebra to lessons in life, the lessons I've learned from you during the\npast 35 years haven't always been easy or even ones that | would have chosen to learn,\nbut they were always important. I'm very grateful to have you for a friend and hope\nthat if you ever need help solving a rate/time/distance problem, you won't hesitate to\ncall.\n\nAll my love,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000075\n\n------------------------------\n\n"

Why would a man like Epstein, who can\npick and choose his companions from princes to professors, select a flying companion\nfrom the Ozark Mountains? To be sure, he was a Rhodes Scholar, but we all know how }\neasy it is to get a Rhodes if you’re from Arkansas. There must be something else.\nVanity Unfair decided to snoop around, The obscure politician reluctantly agreed to an\ninterview, on the express condition that it was completely off the record.

      "bring her to your beautiful, civilized, impressive home on Maple Ave. Think back on that now. That\nshows a lot. it really does. You didn’t give a shit about what she thought. And she couldn’t have been too\nimpressed. You were seriously easy going ~- never up tight. Never worried, always confident. That aspect\nof your personality, of course coupled with your brilliance and intellect is what made you who and what\nyou are today. That don’t give a shit attitude, your calculated aloofness, your sense of humor and most\nimportantly that_ confidence came to you carly on. You had to have confidence and an I don’t give a shit\nattitude to bringliiflinto your Sea Gate world. It worked! You began to realize that you could get away\nwith shit! That chicks and people in general were schmucks! You sensed that you were sharper and more\nastute than most.\n\nEspecially the ones who had women, money, position and power. Yes, your charisma and persuasive ways\ncame very early on. And you didn’t learn life’s lessons in your house. You learned them from us (me,\nfrog, WE) from Europe, Interlochen, our trips to the city and all the people you met along the way. Maybe\nyou picked up a litUe from Timmy, too. Remember meeting Phillie? He’s 16. He said he'll always\nremember how you said that Timmy taught you a lot about business, I know you enhanced that a bit, but\nthat was a great thing to say to a kid., and Pll never forget it either. Warren and Phillie are crazy about\neach other and the kid is obviously enamoured by you and loved meeting you. It meant a lot to him and\nme. He’s really a great kid — has that easy going, confident manner, Good looking kid.\n\nSo now you're fifty. No sweat Jeff. You look great, you’re probably in the best shape of your life and\nyou’re not slowing down one bit. [fno one told you how old you were - wouldn’t you think you were 36\nor something? Just don’t get bored and stay healthy.\n\nAnd then there’s Warren. He’s as hilarious as ever and exactly the same as he was 35 yrs. ago with his\ntrench coat and his business man’s boots BACK THEN! We see each other pretty often. When can\nWarren and I get together w/ you for at Ieast an evening and just get Warren started, you know the way we\nused to, Maybe we need to include Zucca as a prop for Warren.\n\nIf you look at our little group of you , Warren, Frog and me, We were very close, although we never said\nor knew it back then. We didn’t have girlfriends, we never even dated. We didn’t look to our families\nreally for anything, we had cach other. That was through high school. Then when we went to college we\nwere still close but we each began go branch out from the group. We had great times and I’m convinced —\nand | know this as fact: You guys made me what I became today and there’s not a day that goes by that I\ndon’t think about you. So Jeff, even though we don’t speak that often, and our lives don’t intersect, you\nreally are a part of me and ! will always be grateful for the great times we had. You bave been and still are\na great influence for me, You don’t know it, but you're my kid’s role model. That’s why it’s so satisfying\nto recall the past with you. It has shaped both of us. When Warren and | get together, who and what do\nyou think we talk about? You, You, You, You, its constant - Tcan’t stand it anymore.\n\n‘That’s it for now. I know I got a bit sentimental, but it’s the occasion. Take good care. I'll always have\nthe fondest memories of our past and I can honestly say they were the best years of my life - even though I\ncouldn’t ever get laid.\n\nEternally and with love,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000064\n\n------------------------------\n\n"

Amazing because of where and when it started.\nPaula and Seymour fucking. Who was there to tell him where to stick it? Who told him to spit on her cunt\nto make it wet? Maybe they had more on the ball then we all give them credit for.\n\nAnyway from that night back in May of 1953, as they lay there intoxicated from their lovemaking, little did\nthey know what they would be bringing into the world early the next year. Lets fast forward to you. I\nremember summers when Warren would always work some shit ass job (Nathan’s) for minimum wage, I\nwould always find something (Male Ego in Brighten Beach) and Frog would too (Cabana Boy). But you,\nJeff would never work. Yes, you were special. You did things like music camps in Michigan, etc. Which\nbrings me to when you lost your virginity. You may not remember, but I was under the same roof that\ncould new years eve in °66 or ’67 (not sure). The first time | ever flew was with you. I went with you to\nMichigan to visit your friend |. the Interlochen girl for new years eve. It was also the first time 1 bad\never laid eyes on a bright, attractive, bubbly, blue eyed, mid western female. She was like an alien to me.\nShe wasn’t Jewish or Italian. Wasn’t she your first? My first was up in Monticello, where I spent part of\nthe summer with Lloyd and Andy working at Playland Arcade in Monticello. It was Lloyd’s girlfriend.\nAnyway, back to the Michigan trip, because it was significant. Jeff, you took me with you. It was my first\ntime out of Brooklyn. It was no big deal, but we went. And nobody clse ever WENT anywhere back when.\nand where we came from.\n\nAnd then on to Europe. The second time | ever flew. Sabena Airlines to Brussels. Wasn’t it $800 RT. In\nEurope, | really saw a true transformation in you. You lost all of your chubbiness and | remember noticing\nthat you grew a few inches. We both got absolutely skinny in those weeks abroad. I will always remember\nhow you were constantly working the train schedules — riding by night so would have a free place to sleep\nand arriving to our destinations in the morning ready to hit the sites. We'd drink in all that the cities had to\noffer on a budget of $2 a day. Author Frommer’s EUROPE ON $5 A DAY was for suckers. We did it\ncheaper, deeper, wider and better. We saw and learned so much on that memorable trip. We hitch hiked,\nwe biked, we trained, we ferried, we walked, we ran, we always somehow managed to gel where we\nwanted to go and sce what we wanted to see. We slept on trains, boats, beaches, abandoned houses, flop\nhouses, people’s homes, friend’s apts. Everywhere but hotels and hostels. We were too savvy to stay in a\nyouth hostel — weren’t we? Hell, I can’t even remember us having a sit down meal on that trip. We\ncouldn’t care less about food. But we did enjoy all that cheese and bread and train station soup.\nRemember our first night in Europe. It probably was our worst. But, we did steal two heavy, itchy\nblankets from that youth hostel. It was freezing and wet. But things went way up from there. Especially\nthe time Thad a wet dream sleeping in my seat on the ferry from Brendizi (or Bari?) to Corfu. Did I share\nthat with you? Remember the Corfu police detained me on arrival to the Island? We had some scary\nmoments. That’s what made it such a great experience. We stayed on Corfu for 2 weeks or so. Never got\nto London because of that. Corfu was great on the budget and I remember it being great sleeping on the\nbeach with kids from all over the world — Matt on °° and those two girls from Cleveland.\n\nThat wip to Europe could get more space but the main point is that it really opened your eyes to another\n\nworld. And mine too. But you Jeff seized il, I did too in a sense. But you spent the next summer in\nLondon and came home with a beautiful British babe named IBY You had such chuzpah to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000063\n\n------------------------------\n\n"

      "It's no secret that Jeffrey appreciates beautiful women. But not many people know\nthat he can create them out of thin air -- at least he did in Iowa in 1988.\n\nAt the time, I was managing the money of the Zimmerman family, and they lived in\nFairfield Iowa, a town of less than 10,000 people between Ottumwa and Burlington.\nHog farming is a serious industry there, and many feel there is more than a little truth\nto the saying that its hard to tell the difference between the girls and the hogs in\nSoutheast Iowa.\n\n[had invited Jeffrey to come to Fairfield to see our investment operations, meet the\nZimmerman family, and learn more about their major charitable projects. He asked\nabout the nightlife and we could only laugh as we dropped him off at the local motel.\nThe next morning a group of 4 of us picked up Jeffrey to give him a tour of the area.\nAt our first stop we parked in front of a bookstore. As we were getting out of the car ,\na spectacular tall blonde woman suddenly come out of the store, walked directly past\nus and up to Jeffrey and announced: \"I am new to this area, what's going on?\". It\nturned out she was a sales representative for a firm selling academic branded athletic\nclothing, and she was literally driving through Iowa visiting local campuses. Jeffrey\ninvited her to join us, and did his magic. Within a few hours, he had invited her to\nreturn to New York with him for the weekend.\n\nThe guys in the car we astonished to even see such an attractive lady in Fairfield,\namazed that she passed over them to meet Jeff, and were speechless when she agreed\n\nto come to New York. I'll admit to wondering at the time whether Jeffrey somehow\narranged the whole episode through some long distance escort service. But the\nfollowing week I happened to be in Manhattan and Jeffrey asked me to give her a\nride back in our company plane, giving me a chance to speak with her for a few\nhours. She was the real McCoy.\n\nHappy Birthday Jeff!\nBest wishes,\n\nBill Elkus\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000131\n\n------------------------------\n\n"

      "You very dear boy,\n\nvee Going back into the past as | have over the last few days has in some ways prooved a\nmelancholy experience all the old criminals suddenly came leaping out at me\n\nMac, Ogilvy, Swire,Baring,Alfonse, the Brigadier,the old man and all the good times that we\nhad together.One of the sad things in life is that fate conspires to move people apart to the\nextent that | hardly see you any more but,| suppose that is why we are compensated by\nmemories.\n\nvee | was speaking to BB last night before writing this e-mail and we both agreed that we\nwere at a loss to decide which of the hundreds of hilarious incidents to pinpoint for you, there\nare just too many.inspectin: the Royal Schoo! girls dorms,chasing rabbits with Toto in the\nold mans dino, trying to cet busband out of the way in Manila,blocking Ogilvies loo\nwith the illegal goose at Barings wedding ,doing three point turns in the tunnel in HK when\nwe asked the Mandarin driver to find us some girls,dancing the night away in the Tin Mine in\nKL,massage classes at Wraxall..... and so on and so on it brings tears to my eyes.\n\n“° However, there was one evening which I recall always had you howling with laughter.We\nwere in Harry's Bar in London you ,me the old man ,Toto J and the usual extraordinary\ngroup of camp followers Lord Long,lan Gruikshank,etc etc. Somehow Toto got it into his head\nthat [vas a calll girl that doggie had fixed up for him.after dinner we all went off to\nTramps and Toto and doggie got into the back of doggies car with he between\nthem. Toto grinning happily at the old man reached down and pulled skirt up to her\npanties and put his hand on her pussy.The old man smiling sweetly leaned over stuffed his\nhand into her pants so that Toto found his fingers playing with doggies.Suddenly the awful\ntruth sunk in but Toto was too shocked to remove his hand so they drove to Tramps with\nboth of them still trapped in IEEE knickers.\n\n“°° All my love and a very very happy birthday with many more years to come in the future\nthan there are years behind you.\n\nnesvevecoucnesovesccooesoees “Nick.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000135\n\n------------------------------\n\n"

To do this, he dropped a perpendicular line (the one in\nthe picture that cuts through the triangle and the big square) and\n\nclaimed that the two rectangles it divided the big square into had areas\nequal to those of the small squares. To establish that, he showed\n\nthat all four shaded triangles had the same area (which is not too\n\nhard using the 1/2-base-times-height area formula for triangles).\n\nThe structure of the proof is often obscured by using a single\n\ndiagram covered with letters labeling various things.\n\nabout primes in a form that doesn't obviously involve primes.\n\nhort life (and it turns out\n\nublished them earlier, but nobody had noticed!).\n\nare you familia\n\nself-taught mathematician wl\n\nwa\n$\nFI\n8\n=\nSs\n=\n=}\nZ\nEI\nE\na\na\na\nEd\no\n2\n\ndentities discovered by\n1 with Ramanujan?
