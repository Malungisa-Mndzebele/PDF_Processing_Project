SEA GATE
CHRONICLE

Accordion
Torture

By Robert Wolfe
Sea Gate Gazette

‘A Sea Gate boy was forced by
his mother to play “Flight of the
Bumble bee” and “Saber Dance”
on his squeeze box, 100 times a
day for 5 years. By the time the
lad became proficient, he was
able to play the tunes 100 times
in 10 minutes. Firemen from the
318 Hook and Ladder Division
were always called in for his
daily recital, in order to douse the
flames if the boy’s fingers caught
fire from his dervish-like
playing.

‘Months later, the musical
lad’s mom, again forced the boy
against his will, to perfor the
two pieces at Carnegie Hall in
front of thousands attending. She

ed

threatened to withhold his
treasured Nathan’s lobster salad,
if he refused to perform
perfectly. He performed once
again, and was treated to a one-
pound container of his favorite
delicacy.

Seafood Diet??

By Bubbles Axelrod
Coney Island Gourmet

Coney Island Health officials
reported today, that a boy
survived the first 13 years of his
life eating only Nathan’s Lobster
Salad and drinking Sunny Boy
Orange drinks, His mother

specifically went to the beach to
buy the Sunny Boys complete
with conical wax coated
containers and the metal ring at
the mouth. She claimed the
metal ring gave her son bigger
lips for playing saxophone and
‘bassoon; and the lobster salad,
she believed would make her son
agenius. The mother was
committed to an insane asylum in
Florida, and the boy believes he
fas 2 jets, an island, a ranch,
mansions and a sexy English
socialite girlfriend.

After the boy was taken into
custody by officials and fed lox,
bagels and cream cheese, the
hallucinations disappeared. He
was given a % length black
leather coat and returned to his
daily activities of providing free
joe cream and candy to his
friends (courtesy of Jack’s
Firestone funcheonette).

Beach Attack

By Lawrence Dyck
‘Sea Gate Observer

Lloyd Bridges “Human Fish”,
water monger, and a local t-
shirt clad Hippo were attacked by
‘school of deadly Coney Island
Whitefish, The attack occurred
last Saturday just off the Sea
Gate Cabanas at Beach One. The
enraged Hippo then clammed
indiscriminately, and repeatedly
on the chests and faces of the
other victims. The “Human
Fish”, and the water monger also
reported a curious yellow warmth
in the seawater when they came
close to the Hippo. The
swimmers thanked the Hippo for

throwing a fit and clamming, as
it scared the schoo! of whitefish
off. All beaches are flying a
Coney Island Whitefish warning
flag for the remainder of the
swimming season.

Nickel Artist
Arrested

By Lilian Fisher
Handicap Times Magazine

Coney Island's Melvin
Fromholder was best known as
“Mad Mel” the nickel carver.
Mel had the uncanny ability to
cut everything off a buffalo
nickel, leaving only the buffalo
and the “ring” surrounding it.
Customers would travel from all
5 boroughs and wait months to
buy one of the hard-to-get coins,
A local wisecracker named
Larry-John Streitman, tried to
pump Mel for information on
how to mass-produce these coins.
Fromholder was insulted and
became enraged. Mad Mel lived
up to his name when he stabbed
Streitman in the “Stomach and
the Leg” 10 times. Ironically,
Streitman was wearing a cheap
copy of Mel’s original “No
Hassle Band” on his wrist when
he was attacked. “If it wasn’t for
the “No Hassle Band”, said
Streitman, “1 woulda been
dead”.

Fromholder is doing hard
time, and can’t fill customer’s
orders for the nickels because
officials refused to let Mel have
his tools. You'd better get in
linc; Mad Mel’s in for 5 years
and he’s got 5125 orders for the
prized buffalo nickels.

a Budget

By Yehudab Leibig
‘Sons of Israel Travel Guide

Two Sea Gate teens claim to
have started out with $500 each,
and managed to travel Europe for
2 months. The boys hitch-hiked,
wandered and adventured
through Europe while their stupid
friend served hamburgers and
french fies at Nathan's. The two
returned with long hair, suntans
and 2 brand new Triumph Tiger
500 Motorcycles, they even had
change to boot, One of the two
actually lost 40 pounds, because
of the serious lobster shortage in
Europe.

Hunchback.
Dies

By Not so Lucky Luclifeld

Firecracker Chronicle

Robert Avner, Coney Island’s
only living hunchback died last
‘week of an infected hunch.
Observers witnessed Avner
screaming at his friends for help
with his itching back. “Scratch
like a bitch, scratch like a bitch”
he pleaded, but it was too late,
no one would scratch the infected
hunch. Avner died of whiplash
from repeatedly turning his head
to far left and far right during his
last minutes.

Teen Bitten

Woolworth Newsletter

A Sea Gate teenager (name
withheld) was viciously bitten on
the neck by crazed Steve
Jankowitz. The bitten youth was
found crying after witness

gruesome details. Sea Gate cops
were unable to capture the
foaming-mad Jankowitz, which.

the Sea Gate Chapel Bulletin
Board.

Pizza Man
Goes Berserk!

By Yetta Parnes
Yenta Times

Pizza man Luigi Tortoni flew
into a fit of rage after employer
Arthur Stern (owner of the famed
restaurants, “The Spot” and “The
Riviera Snack Bar”) told Luigi
‘that he would start using fake
cheese in his pizza, Tortoni
exploded and held Stern at knife
point until Sgt. Gino “Gene”
Venezia of Sea Gate Police
S.W.A.T. team negotiated with
the mad Italian. The straight-
jacketed Tortoni was promptly
shipped back to Italy. Sources
report that Luigi Tortoni is now a
famous spumoni scoop designer
frequently seen on the prestigious
Vespa racing circuit.

Dermatologis
Fights Fire

By Robert Ardigo
Pizza Face Pages

World renowned Pimple
Expert Dr. Shin Ho Yep claims
the secret to a great complexion
is in his secret formula.

‘Hundreds of butter face teens
flock to Dr. Yep’s office off
Ocean Pkwy. in Brooklyn to
obtain much needed help. The
Dr. applies his “secret formula”
to kid’s faces and within seconds
their skin feels like a raging,
inferno. Some patients wail in
agony from the fiery concoction,
and if they scream loud enough,
Yep says “just 10 more minutes”.
if they start to cry, Dr. Yep
proclaims “OK we put out fire
now”, He takes a tissue and puts
2 drops of water on it and barely
dabs at the blistering skin,
Chemical analysis of Yep’s
“secret formula” found it to be
nothing but a combination of
straight hydrochloric and sulfuric
acids.

The results: a cranberry sauce
red appearance immediately after
treatment, but after two weeks,
all but one kinicy haired Sea Gate
boy , had a peaches and cream
complexion.

By Stanley Komito

Four rebellious Sea Gate boys,
two of whom barely graduated,
were caught wearing dungarees and

gowns. The graduation exercises
took place at a famous movie
theater in downtown Brooklyn.

2 Barely
Graduate

By Carl Ashby
‘Health Ed Joumal

After making a mockery of phys-ed
class for the majority of their senior
year, Coach Gary Lasker pulled
two teens from gym class 6 weeks
before graduation and gave them
the bad news: they weren’t going
to graduatel! Although the 2 boys
had virtually straight A’s in
academics, they were total losers
when it came to gym. They
pleaded with Mr. Lasker and asked
what they could do to make it up.
After thinking about a just
punishment, he required the
students to double time in every
gym class. They had to do twice
the exercise, twice the running, as
well as lead the class in exercise
until the end of the schoo! year.
Lasker also humiliated the boys in
front of each and every class, but
allowed them to graduate with a
grade of one point over the
minimum passing grade of 65.

Yellow Laundry
Mystery Solved

By Beatrice K. Cooper
Read a Book-a-Day Club

An obese Sea Gate Cauily started
to notice that their laundry
mysteriously started turning yellow
every time they removed it from
(cont’d pg. 6, column 1)

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000041

------------------------------

--- Page 42 ---
the clothes line. Mrs. Bulla claims
she uses Clorox bleach in every
wash load, but the laundry
curiously turns yellow and has an
ammonia smell after it dries. This
happened for months until her son
Gerald started doing some detective
work on hisown. After 2 more
months of surveillance, Gerald
Bulla caught the culprit red (or
should I say yellow) handed. The
Bulla’s downstairs neighbor’s son
had been repeatedly squirting the
laundry with a squirt gun filled
with an unknown yellow liquid.
‘The Bullas were forced to move
away after more highjinks
occurred

5 Graders
Clean up
Coney

By Nelly Bly
Graves End Books

‘Mr, Stephen Levy whip-trained
his over-achieving class 5-3 until
they mastered Easy Steps March
and Aida, Only then would he
allow them to be featured in the
Prestigious Coney Island Clean Up
Campaign Parade. The long
awaited Parade arrived, and the
fifth graders had to march in
sweltering 110 degree heat. Fifteen
of the 45 kids suffered heat
exhaustion, and one saxophone
player continued marching and
playing until midnight. The Sea
Gate boy marched until his pinky
toe popped through the side of his
signature blue Keds boat sneakers.
He was awarded the “Schmuck of
the Coney Island Clean up

——————

Campaign“ award. Because of
the notoriety the student gave Keds,
they offered him a lifetime supply
of the sneakers, as long as those
were the only shoes he would ever
wear in the future. The same offer
came from a local sweatshirt
manufacturer, but they eventually
went out of business after giving
the kid so many free sweatshirts.
He still wears them today, but has
his kid brother silk screen different
logos on them such as “POLICE”,
“ZORRO” and “SHMITKA”

Teacher Almost
Gets the Boot

By Emil Suskind
PS. 188 News

Sixth grade teacher Ed
Goldsmith, was never known to be
a conventional thinker by his peers,
but his students really enjoyed his
‘non-conformism. With his dry wit
and different way of looking at
things, the students were always
‘educated, as well as entertained
His colleagues never respected
Goldsmith and probably resented
his odd approach.

On assembly day in April of
1964, Mr. Goldsmith, an
accomplished jazz pianist, played
the national anthem in a “jazzed-
up” version, and sent the
auditorium reeling into a near riot.
‘The teachers hated the rendition,
calling it a mockery and a disgrace,
while the children clapped and
snapped to the coolest version of
the anthem they’d ever heard!

On the next day, Mr. Goldsmith
was handed his walking papers by
the school administration, and
made an announcement to his class,
that he was forced to leave. The
{cont'd pg. 7, column 1)

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000042

------------------------------

--- Page 43 ---
students were dismayed, some to
the point of crying. When they
notified their parents of the
administration's decision, students
along with their parents went on
strike the following day. They
demanded a reversal of the
decision, stating that the teacher
was the one most influential
persons contributing to the
student’s creative thinking, After a
multi-hour standoff, the
administration backed down and
allowed Mr, Goldsmith to continue
teaching until the end of the term.
Ed Goldsmith stated that he would
not return to the school after that
year.

‘The kids really loved that man.

Famed diminutive math teacher
Joseph “Mighty Joe” Rothman, has
been a fixture at Mark Twain JHS
for over 35 years, Students have
taunted the midget math man ever
since he started teaching. Year
after year of being teased by the

poor grades, the students held a

Near Drowning
in Chocolate

By Willy the Soda Jerk
Firestone Candy Papers

A brillo haired teenager was
nearly drowned in Fox’s U bet
chocolate syrup when his four
friends held him down and poured
10 jars of the thick, rich, velvety
egg cream component. After 5
minutes of the syrup torture, the
kinky teen suffered from terminal
acne and was immediately
ambulanced to Dr. Shin Ho Yep, @
pimple specialist. ‘The Dr. refused
treatment, as the acne was too far-

gone, “To much peempoo; cannot
fix”, the doctor, said. The crater-
face teen now has to check his oil
every 10 minutes, for fear of greasy
build-up. As punishment, his
friends were required to provide
him with a Jifetime supply of Oxy
10.

Near Miss on

Belt Pkwy.

By Officer Bits
Sea Gate Police Bulletin

Last Friday, 3 Sea Gate boys
perpetrated a hoax on popular math
tutor Richard “Dicky” Freed. One
boy set the scam up by mentioning
that he needed math tutoring,
knowing that Dicky would surely
zero in on this “needy student”.
Freed took the boy onto the Belt
Pkwy. in his navy blue 63 Chevy
Belair. Once they reached the large
gas tanks on the way to Sheepshead
Bay, two other boys who were
hiding behind the back seat popped
up and scared the dickens out of
Dicky. He temporarily lost control
of the vehicle when both arms went

off the steering wheel and up to the
roof of the vehicle as he shrieked in
fear. The 3 boys laughed
hysterically as Freed “s car
careened through 3 lanes of traffic,
almost flipping over the guard rail.
Police reported the incident to the
boys’ parents. The punishment: 2
boys- no color TV for One weck!!
The 3" boy was deprived of his
precious lobster salad for one week.
Freed returned to normal tutoring,
after # week of shoe polishing and
recuperation from the mental
trauma,

Fans wild over
Dynamite Tuna

By Chaim Gitler
‘Mermaid Ave. Gourmet

Every so often, a genius comes
along with a new recipe that takes
the world by storm. The genius
this time?... the son of a Coney
Jstand fireman, who worked for
months honing the magic recipe for
the perfect tuna salad. The entire
neighborhood waits on fine for
hours outside the fireman’s house,
for just one small taste of the
“miracle tuna”. Folks can’t believe
that the young lad had the wisdom
or knowledge to create such a
masterpiece in tuna.

When asked for the recipe, the
teen will only reveal one part of the
secret “It has to do with squeezing
the oil out of the tuna,

then rinsing it with water”, he said.
Sources also reported seeing used
Hellman’s mayo jars in the trash
cans behind the house. According
to national tuna experts, this could
be another major breakthrough in
solving the “miracle tuna” puzzle,.

The “tuna boy”, as he is now
known, commented: “Tf you like
my tuna, wait till you taste my
fantastic “Wonder Slaw” cole slaw,
and my soon-to-be famous Galliano
Milk Shake”.

Teen brings
home Brit

By Merton Boober
LN.A. Rescue Sheet

A cocky Coney Island teenager
met a genuine British Pachoochie
and had the audacity to bring her
home to live in his parent’s house.
His mother never trusted the
pachoochie and believed that she
insidiously sapped the intelligence
and manlihood from her son. After
months of monitoring and
recording observed data, the
mother supplied the LN.S. with all
the dope on this wild Englander
and had her deported. When the
boy regained his senses, he had
totally forgotten any details of the
British pachoochie.

Ejected from
Singles
Weekend

By Henny Youngman
Catskills Comics

Coney Island teens signed up for
what should have been a fun
singles weekend at Kutsher’s
Country Club, but something went
awry. After causing disturbance at
the pool, the young men went to
their room and made so much noise
that security had to come and warn
them of probable ejection from the
premises. Later on, the trouble-
makers arrived at the main
ballroom for dinner. Each table
was matched with boys and girls
for the event. Again, the boys were
causing more trouble, and by the
time the food was served, the
crowning blow occurred. One of
the teens known as. “Neutral”,
started eating directly out of the
large salad serving bowl. To make
things worse, he ate without knife
or fork, much like a mad dog. He
was actually foaming at the mouth,
growling, and jerking his head up
and down as he chewed the salad
Needless to say, the boys were
immediately escorted from the
ballroom, and promptly told to
leave Kutcher’s without delay.

5917 GLENDORA AVE.

DALLAS, TEXAS 75230
214 987 3595

January 15, 2003
Dallas, Texas

Dearest Jeff:

Fifty years old. You really have had a pretty amazing life. Amazing because of where and when it started.
Paula and Seymour fucking. Who was there to tell him where to stick it? Who told him to spit on her cunt
to make it wet? Maybe they had more on the ball then we all give them credit for.

Anyway from that night back in May of 1953, as they lay there intoxicated from their lovemaking, little did
they know what they would be bringing into the world early the next year. Lets fast forward to you. I
remember summers when Warren would always work some shit ass job (Nathan’s) for minimum wage, I
would always find something (Male Ego in Brighten Beach) and Frog would too (Cabana Boy). But you,
Jeff would never work. Yes, you were special. You did things like music camps in Michigan, etc. Which
brings me to when you lost your virginity. You may not remember, but I was under the same roof that
could new years eve in °66 or ’67 (not sure). The first time | ever flew was with you. I went with you to
Michigan to visit your friend |. the Interlochen girl for new years eve. It was also the first time 1 bad
ever laid eyes on a bright, attractive, bubbly, blue eyed, mid western female. She was like an alien to me.
She wasn’t Jewish or Italian. Wasn’t she your first? My first was up in Monticello, where I spent part of
the summer with Lloyd and Andy working at Playland Arcade in Monticello. It was Lloyd’s girlfriend.
Anyway, back to the Michigan trip, because it was significant. Jeff, you took me with you. It was my first
time out of Brooklyn. It was no big deal, but we went. And nobody clse ever WENT anywhere back when.
and where we came from.

And then on to Europe. The second time | ever flew. Sabena Airlines to Brussels. Wasn’t it $800 RT. In
Europe, | really saw a true transformation in you. You lost all of your chubbiness and | remember noticing
that you grew a few inches. We both got absolutely skinny in those weeks abroad. I will always remember
how you were constantly working the train schedules — riding by night so would have a free place to sleep
and arriving to our destinations in the morning ready to hit the sites. We'd drink in all that the cities had to
offer on a budget of $2 a day. Author Frommer’s EUROPE ON $5 A DAY was for suckers. We did it
cheaper, deeper, wider and better. We saw and learned so much on that memorable trip. We hitch hiked,
we biked, we trained, we ferried, we walked, we ran, we always somehow managed to gel where we
wanted to go and sce what we wanted to see. We slept on trains, boats, beaches, abandoned houses, flop
houses, people’s homes, friend’s apts. Everywhere but hotels and hostels. We were too savvy to stay in a
youth hostel — weren’t we? Hell, I can’t even remember us having a sit down meal on that trip. We
couldn’t care less about food. But we did enjoy all that cheese and bread and train station soup.
Remember our first night in Europe. It probably was our worst. But, we did steal two heavy, itchy
blankets from that youth hostel. It was freezing and wet. But things went way up from there. Especially
the time Thad a wet dream sleeping in my seat on the ferry from Brendizi (or Bari?) to Corfu. Did I share
that with you? Remember the Corfu police detained me on arrival to the Island? We had some scary
moments. That’s what made it such a great experience. We stayed on Corfu for 2 weeks or so. Never got
to London because of that. Corfu was great on the budget and I remember it being great sleeping on the
beach with kids from all over the world — Matt on °° and those two girls from Cleveland.

That wip to Europe could get more space but the main point is that it really opened your eyes to another

world. And mine too. But you Jeff seized il, I did too in a sense. But you spent the next summer in
London and came home with a beautiful British babe named IBY You had such chuzpah to

HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_000063

------------------------------

--- Page 64 ---
bring her to your beautiful, civilized, impressive home on Maple Ave. Think back on that now. That
shows a lot. it really does. You didn’t give a shit about what she thought. And she couldn’t have been too
impressed. You were seriously easy going ~- never up tight. Never worried, always confident. That aspect
of your personality, of course coupled with your brilliance and intellect is what made you who and what
you are today. That don’t give a shit attitude, your calculated aloofness, your sense of humor and most
importantly that_ confidence came to you carly on. You had to have confidence and an I don’t give a shit
attitude to bringliiflinto your Sea Gate world. It worked! You began to realize that you could get away
with shit! That chicks and people in general were schmucks! You sensed that you were sharper and more
astute than most.

Especially the ones who had women, money, position and power. Yes, your charisma and persuasive ways
came very early on. And you didn’t learn life’s lessons in your house. You learned them from us (me,
frog, WE) from Europe, Interlochen, our trips to the city and all the people you met along the way. Maybe
you picked up a litUe from Timmy, too. Remember meeting Phillie? He’s 16. He said he'll always
remember how you said that Timmy taught you a lot about business, I know you enhanced that a bit, but
that was a great thing to say to a kid., and Pll never forget it either. Warren and Phillie are crazy about
each other and the kid is obviously enamoured by you and loved meeting you. It meant a lot to him and
me. He’s really a great kid — has that easy going, confident manner, Good looking kid.

So now you're fifty. No sweat Jeff. You look great, you’re probably in the best shape of your life and
you’re not slowing down one bit. [fno one told you how old you were - wouldn’t you think you were 36
or something? Just don’t get bored and stay healthy.

And then there’s Warren. He’s as hilarious as ever and exactly the same as he was 35 yrs. ago with his
trench coat and his business man’s boots BACK THEN! We see each other pretty often. When can
Warren and I get together w/ you for at Ieast an evening and just get Warren started, you know the way we
used to, Maybe we need to include Zucca as a prop for Warren.

If you look at our little group of you , Warren, Frog and me, We were very close, although we never said
or knew it back then. We didn’t have girlfriends, we never even dated. We didn’t look to our families
really for anything, we had cach other. That was through high school. Then when we went to college we
were still close but we each began go branch out from the group. We had great times and I’m convinced —
and | know this as fact: You guys made me what I became today and there’s not a day that goes by that I
don’t think about you. So Jeff, even though we don’t speak that often, and our lives don’t intersect, you
really are a part of me and ! will always be grateful for the great times we had. You bave been and still are
a great influence for me, You don’t know it, but you're my kid’s role model. That’s why it’s so satisfying
to recall the past with you. It has shaped both of us. When Warren and | get together, who and what do
you think we talk about? You, You, You, You, its constant - Tcan’t stand it anymore.

‘That’s it for now. I know I got a bit sentimental, but it’s the occasion. Take good care. I'll always have
the fondest memories of our past and I can honestly say they were the best years of my life - even though I
couldn’t ever get laid.

Eternally and with love,

December, 2002

Jeffrey,

You could never imagine the surprise | felt when Ghislaine first contacted me about writing something for your
memory book.

Over the years I have thought of Class 5-3 & 6-3, numerous times with affection and really fond memories. After all,
you guys were my second class EVER and [ had just transferred from my first job, which was in, of all places, Fort
Apache, The Bronx! Imagine, coming from a class of hold-overs, delinquents, and worse, to a class of “Intellectually
Gifted Children.” Believe me, it was quite a chore just to keep one step ahead of that class.

One day, about 2 weeks ago, ! was on the Norther State Parkway on my way home, creeping along at § miles an
hour, in the midst of a snowstorm, when my cell phone rang, | spent the next 15 minutes or so reliving the past with
Warren, who was calling from sunny Dallas, Texas. As we talked and he mentioned students’ names, most of the
faces flashed before my eyes. I even told him.... Jeffrey, saxophone, Michael, clarinet, Warren, saxophone and so on
for most of the class. He later sent me a picture of the class and there | was, much thinner, with black horn-rimmed
glasses and a full head of dark brown hair. There you were, just as I remembered you, with a Mona Lisa smile that
hid what was really going on in that interesting brain of yours. Who could have guessed the wonderful, fascinating
things that were in store for you?

I remember discussing Abraham Lincoln with the class and staring in wonder at the student who had read all of
Sandberg’s Life of Lincoln and spouted facts of which | was totally unaware. | also remember my math (never my
strong suit) being corrected from time to time, very respectfully, by Jeffrey. I also remember the Coney Island
Cleanup Parade and performing onstage at Lafayette and blowing away the audience who had just listened to a
Junior High orchestra.

I have many awards and plaques on my office wails, at home and at work.... too many for any one place, but for all
these years | stiil treasure and display the gold painted, wooden plaque that I received from your class for being the
“Best Teacher.”

I’m thrilled and delighted that you still remember me and that in some small way I may have made a difference and
touched your life. Happy Birthday!

In 1963, you were around 10 and I was 23.... twice as old as you. Today you are 50 and I’m 63.,.. somehow you’re

catching up! How did that happen?

Dearest Jeffrey,

if | were to list my life time achievements, surely scoring higher than you on the nineth
grade algebra regent would rank in the top ten. I'll never forget the exhilaration of
considering myself smarter than Jeffrey Epstein in math. That same year, you not only
performed mathematical magic by tutoring me to get a perfect score on the regent,
you thrilled our class in music by playing "California Dreaming" on the piano, and thrilled
me even more by stealing a kiss after "The Sound of Music" at Radio City Music Hall.

When we met again some time after college, you had shoulder length curls, wore
wonderful hand-embroidered denim work shirts and tight jeans, and drove a brown
Camaro with a glove compartment full of parking tickets. Needless to say, you had
outgrown your shyness around girls and even confessed that you participated in peace
marches because they were the easiest places to get laid. A truly unique perspective
on political activism in the 70's.

A few years later during a trip to Palm Beach, we were driving around admiring the
homes when you pointed in the direction of a particularly impressive mansion and said,
"One day, I'm going to own that." | smiled and considered your comment nothing more
than wishful thinking. Many mansions later, you have shown me the importance of
having a vision and the determination to pursue it. A lesson | continue to rely upon for
inspiration.

From lessons in algebra to lessons in life, the lessons I've learned from you during the
past 35 years haven't always been easy or even ones that | would have chosen to learn,
but they were always important. I'm very grateful to have you for a friend and hope
that if you ever need help solving a rate/time/distance problem, you won't hesitate to
call.

All my love,

This album was specially designed and hand-bound for you by WEITZ-COLEMAN
using only the finest calf and Moroccan skins which are individually selected and
vegetable tanned for bookbinding. Variations in color and surface markings are natural
characteristics of fine leather and are your assurance of its quality. The buttery softness
of calfskin give it great tactile appeal and lends itself to easy scuffing which develops
into an exquisite antique patina. We recommend that the binding be treated with lanolin
and neatsfoot oil at least once a year. You may bring in your WEITZ-COLEMAN
binding for a complimentary treatment.

Finally, at the home of our friend, let’s call him Mr. Brown, J effrey
unveiled his plan. To some it may have seemed a get-rich-quick scheme, but
to me it was pure genius: Rob and Kill was the name of the plan. The first
victim, a be attacked and brutally plundered ( would
she want more than that?) on the boardwalk in Venice Beach. Broad
daylight. The dastardly thieves were never caught.

Postscript: I retired from “the life”, but I recently read an article in New
York which led me to believe that my old friend Mr. E had continued on and

become an industry leader.

Jeffrey was such a nice man, a sweet, innocent type. One ot my employees
called him Mr. Epstein, the math teacher. Always ready to lend a hand, help
a friend in need. He even volunteered to help out in surgery at UCLA,
scrubbed, put on the gown, the whole bit, just to do his part.

Then, things began to change. I think it was shortly after he encouraged
Morgan to say “woof” on the phone to me that I noticed the beginning. And
then, while his friends were willing to either go blissfully ahead, eyes closed,
trusting in the Almighty, Jeffrey began to get that look in his eye. He was
cooking up something, something either evil or at least deadly. I always
hoped he wasn’t spurred to action by my action — the unforgivable, immortal
sin of getting married.

Dear Jeffrey,

As a birthday gift to you, I managed to obtain an early version of the Vanity Unfair
article. I talked them into changing the focus from you to Bill Clinton, as you will see
from the enclosed excerpt. Happy birthday and best regards.

Who Was That Man With Epstein?

Enquiring minds are asking, “Who was that man with Epstein?” Jeffrey Epstein is, of
course, one of the world’s most famous men, a household name throughout the planet. |
His picture has appeared on the cover of every magazine in the world. Everyone knows

his story - - from his humble roots on Coney Island to his rise as one of the most envied |
public figures of the western world. But what was he doing flying to Africa with an
obscure former politician from Hope, Arkansas? Who is that politician and why would
Epstein have picked him for the coveted seat on his private jet. Vanity Unfair was
determined to get to the bottom. of this mystery man and to reveal the story behind the
story. Normally we would not pry into the private life of an obscure Arkansas
politician, particularly one who has tried so hard, and up to now so successfully, to keep
his private life to himself, But the moment this obscure man stepped onto the Epstein
jet, he became fair game for probing enquiry. Why would a man like Epstein, who can
pick and choose his companions from princes to professors, select a flying companion
from the Ozark Mountains? To be sure, he was a Rhodes Scholar, but we all know how }
easy it is to get a Rhodes if you’re from Arkansas. There must be something else.
Vanity Unfair decided to snoop around, The obscure politician reluctantly agreed to an
interview, on the express condition that it was completely off the record. This is what
he told us...

It's no secret that Jeffrey appreciates beautiful women. But not many people know
that he can create them out of thin air -- at least he did in Iowa in 1988.

At the time, I was managing the money of the Zimmerman family, and they lived in
Fairfield Iowa, a town of less than 10,000 people between Ottumwa and Burlington.
Hog farming is a serious industry there, and many feel there is more than a little truth
to the saying that its hard to tell the difference between the girls and the hogs in
Southeast Iowa.

[had invited Jeffrey to come to Fairfield to see our investment operations, meet the
Zimmerman family, and learn more about their major charitable projects. He asked
about the nightlife and we could only laugh as we dropped him off at the local motel.
The next morning a group of 4 of us picked up Jeffrey to give him a tour of the area.
At our first stop we parked in front of a bookstore. As we were getting out of the car ,
a spectacular tall blonde woman suddenly come out of the store, walked directly past
us and up to Jeffrey and announced: "I am new to this area, what's going on?". It
turned out she was a sales representative for a firm selling academic branded athletic
clothing, and she was literally driving through Iowa visiting local campuses. Jeffrey
invited her to join us, and did his magic. Within a few hours, he had invited her to
return to New York with him for the weekend.

The guys in the car we astonished to even see such an attractive lady in Fairfield,
amazed that she passed over them to meet Jeff, and were speechless when she agreed

to come to New York. I'll admit to wondering at the time whether Jeffrey somehow
arranged the whole episode through some long distance escort service. But the
following week I happened to be in Manhattan and Jeffrey asked me to give her a
ride back in our company plane, giving me a chance to speak with her for a few
hours. She was the real McCoy.

Happy Birthday Jeff!
Best wishes,

Bill Elkus

The analysis: A fiercely intelligent, highly complex individual for whom the
accumulation of great wealth is no problem. Prefers working in private, or
better yet, utter secrecy. Emotionally complicated: Can run hot and cold, can
lose interest in the blink of an eye, professes to be “available” but much goes
on behind the scenes and he decides what he gives. Extensive
scientific/humanitarian/philanthropic strength and cointerest, which if
harnessed and developed properly could have a significant impact (as in
tangibly changing the world for the better) and as an added bonus, beat the
current masters at their own game.

You very dear boy,

vee Going back into the past as | have over the last few days has in some ways prooved a
melancholy experience all the old criminals suddenly came leaping out at me

Mac, Ogilvy, Swire,Baring,Alfonse, the Brigadier,the old man and all the good times that we
had together.One of the sad things in life is that fate conspires to move people apart to the
extent that | hardly see you any more but,| suppose that is why we are compensated by
memories.

vee | was speaking to BB last night before writing this e-mail and we both agreed that we
were at a loss to decide which of the hundreds of hilarious incidents to pinpoint for you, there
are just too many.inspectin: the Royal Schoo! girls dorms,chasing rabbits with Toto in the
old mans dino, trying to cet busband out of the way in Manila,blocking Ogilvies loo
with the illegal goose at Barings wedding ,doing three point turns in the tunnel in HK when
we asked the Mandarin driver to find us some girls,dancing the night away in the Tin Mine in
KL,massage classes at Wraxall..... and so on and so on it brings tears to my eyes.

“° However, there was one evening which I recall always had you howling with laughter.We
were in Harry's Bar in London you ,me the old man ,Toto J and the usual extraordinary
group of camp followers Lord Long,lan Gruikshank,etc etc. Somehow Toto got it into his head
that [vas a calll girl that doggie had fixed up for him.after dinner we all went off to
Tramps and Toto and doggie got into the back of doggies car with he between
them. Toto grinning happily at the old man reached down and pulled skirt up to her
panties and put his hand on her pussy.The old man smiling sweetly leaned over stuffed his
hand into her pants so that Toto found his fingers playing with doggies.Suddenly the awful
truth sunk in but Toto was too shocked to remove his hand so they drove to Tramps with
both of them still trapped in IEEE knickers.

“°° All my love and a very very happy birthday with many more years to come in the future
than there are years behind you.

—————————

Jeffery,

tT have agonized jong and hard about what to write for your
pirthday-

One version was a highly philosophical take on personal
perception. T'il

spare you the tortured prose but the gist was that the way We see
the world

depends on our experiences ~ how we parse things. you're one of
the few

people who has influenced how 1 parse and understand the world,
and that

version lauded you for it.

But, that seemed to heavy and pedantic, S° out it went.-

Another version was silly and salacious, since your approach to
life has so

much of each of these things. A few years ago somebody at 4
party asked me

"poes Jeffrey Epstein manage your money?"- I replied "No, put he
advises

me on lifestyle". The guys eyes bugged out of his head and he
said

"REALLY ?"-

Alas I am ill prepared to comment on your lifestyle in any detail,
since I

am (sadly) s° far behind that it would pe talking about things
know little

of!

yet another approach was to comment on our shard interests in
science and
exploration, put again it seemed lacking.

So, in the end I have wound up with this silly excuse for a

missive ~

neither profound nor funny. But, I've included a few photos
that I took

on my recent trip to Africa. They seemed more appropriate than

anything 1
could put in words.

Nathan

The man of means
in sweat shirt and jeans |
At a black tie formal affair

To add to life’s piquancy

Jeffery, with increasing frequency.

on any occasion
with little persuasion,
Will outrage the public decency.

I have heard that Jeffrey will act
With morals, decorum and tact,
with honor, good will
and truth, but forsooth,
This information may be inexact.

As far as I can detect,
Jeffrey seems to select

To express his mood,

Terms rude, crude and lewd,
and politically incorrect.

Jeffrey at half a century,

with credentials plenipotentiary,
though up to no good
whenever he could,

has avoided the penitentiary. ~

The first equation is a fundamental property of the
Riemann zeta function (that it is both a sum over all
integers and a product over primes). The zeta function
is a very important function, and this equation partially
explains why people care about it (although this may not
be apparent from the equation :-): it encodes information

The first picture is a visualization of Euclid's proof of the
Pythagorean theorem. He wanted to show that the big square on
the hypotenuse had area exactly equal to those of the small squares
combined. To do this, he dropped a perpendicular line (the one in
the picture that cuts through the triangle and the big square) and

claimed that the two rectangles it divided the big square into had areas
equal to those of the small squares. To establish that, he showed

that all four shaded triangles had the same area (which is not too

hard using the 1/2-base-times-height area formula for triangles).

The structure of the proof is often obscured by using a single

diagram covered with letters labeling various things.

The mathematics of life

Martin Nowak
Epstein Institute, Harvard University

The primordial soup, here or elsewhere, generated a
quasispecies of aperiodic macromolecules. Quasispecies
live in sequence space, which is a collection of hyper-
dimensional cubes. Each cybe arises by ordering all _
possible sequences of a certain length in such a way that
nearest neighbors differ in only one position. The length of
ifte genome determines the dimension of the cube. A very
small gene, for example, lives in a 1000 dimensional cube.
Its sequence is 1 particular choice out of 10® possibilities.

For comparison there are only 40° protons in our universe.

Quasispecies live in

An alphabetis a finite list of symbols. Sentences are strings of symbols.
A language Is a set of sentences. A finite language has a finite number of
sentences. An infinite language has an infinite number of sentences. There
are infinitely many finite languages.

Human languages are infinite.

A grammar is a finite list of rules that generates a language. Grammars
are equivalent to computers. Finite state grammars generate regular
languages which are accepted by finite state machines. Phrase structure
grammars give rise to computable languages which are Turing complete.
For each such language there exists a Turing machine that accepts every
sentence that is part of the language, but may compute forever on
sentences that do not belong the language.

The language of mathematics is not computable.

Learning is selection among a restricted set of hypothocos.
Ambitious learners exceed their teachers.

When Jeffrey joined Bear, Stearns twenty-four years
ago, it was our plan to put him on the American Stock
Exchange floor to trade options on common stocks.

Up until then, options had been traded Over the
Counter. Jeff said no, and that was the last difference
we ever had.

Working with Jeffrey has been a pleasure and watching
his meteoric success has given me many vicarious

thrills.

Lam sure that we will see Jeffrey’s star glow even
brighter. ya

Good luck Jeffrey —

J effey I remember in the mid 1970s you being a star salesman for
our tax advantaged strategies and hedged option program. I was:
running an account for Bob Maxwell. You always had the ability

discovered the Maxwell teen-age daughter...... Happy Birthday
