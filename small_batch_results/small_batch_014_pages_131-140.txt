It's no secret that Jeffrey appreciates beautiful women. But not many people know
that he can create them out of thin air -- at least he did in Iowa in 1988.

At the time, I was managing the money of the Zimmerman family, and they lived in
Fairfield Iowa, a town of less than 10,000 people between Ottumwa and Burlington.
Hog farming is a serious industry there, and many feel there is more than a little truth
to the saying that its hard to tell the difference between the girls and the hogs in
Southeast Iowa.

[had invited Jeffrey to come to Fairfield to see our investment operations, meet the
Zimmerman family, and learn more about their major charitable projects. He asked
about the nightlife and we could only laugh as we dropped him off at the local motel.
The next morning a group of 4 of us picked up Jeffrey to give him a tour of the area.
At our first stop we parked in front of a bookstore. As we were getting out of the car ,
a spectacular tall blonde woman suddenly come out of the store, walked directly past
us and up to Jeffrey and announced: "I am new to this area, what's going on?". It
turned out she was a sales representative for a firm selling academic branded athletic
clothing, and she was literally driving through Iowa visiting local campuses. Jeffrey
invited her to join us, and did his magic. Within a few hours, he had invited her to
return to New York with him for the weekend.

The guys in the car we astonished to even see such an attractive lady in Fairfield,
amazed that she passed over them to meet Jeff, and were speechless when she agreed

to come to New York. I'll admit to wondering at the time whether Jeffrey somehow
arranged the whole episode through some long distance escort service. But the
following week I happened to be in Manhattan and Jeffrey asked me to give her a
ride back in our company plane, giving me a chance to speak with her for a few
hours. She was the real McCoy.

Happy Birthday Jeff!
Best wishes,

Bill Elkus

The analysis: A fiercely intelligent, highly complex individual for whom the
accumulation of great wealth is no problem. Prefers working in private, or
better yet, utter secrecy. Emotionally complicated: Can run hot and cold, can
lose interest in the blink of an eye, professes to be “available” but much goes
on behind the scenes and he decides what he gives. Extensive
scientific/humanitarian/philanthropic strength and cointerest, which if
harnessed and developed properly could have a significant impact (as in
tangibly changing the world for the better) and as an added bonus, beat the
current masters at their own game.

You very dear boy,

vee Going back into the past as | have over the last few days has in some ways prooved a
melancholy experience all the old criminals suddenly came leaping out at me

Mac, Ogilvy, Swire,Baring,Alfonse, the Brigadier,the old man and all the good times that we
had together.One of the sad things in life is that fate conspires to move people apart to the
extent that | hardly see you any more but,| suppose that is why we are compensated by
memories.

vee | was speaking to BB last night before writing this e-mail and we both agreed that we
were at a loss to decide which of the hundreds of hilarious incidents to pinpoint for you, there
are just too many.inspectin: the Royal Schoo! girls dorms,chasing rabbits with Toto in the
old mans dino, trying to cet busband out of the way in Manila,blocking Ogilvies loo
with the illegal goose at Barings wedding ,doing three point turns in the tunnel in HK when
we asked the Mandarin driver to find us some girls,dancing the night away in the Tin Mine in
KL,massage classes at Wraxall..... and so on and so on it brings tears to my eyes.

“° However, there was one evening which I recall always had you howling with laughter.We
were in Harry's Bar in London you ,me the old man ,Toto J and the usual extraordinary
group of camp followers Lord Long,lan Gruikshank,etc etc. Somehow Toto got it into his head
that [vas a calll girl that doggie had fixed up for him.after dinner we all went off to
Tramps and Toto and doggie got into the back of doggies car with he between
them. Toto grinning happily at the old man reached down and pulled skirt up to her
panties and put his hand on her pussy.The old man smiling sweetly leaned over stuffed his
hand into her pants so that Toto found his fingers playing with doggies.Suddenly the awful
truth sunk in but Toto was too shocked to remove his hand so they drove to Tramps with
both of them still trapped in IEEE knickers.

“°° All my love and a very very happy birthday with many more years to come in the future
than there are years behind you.
