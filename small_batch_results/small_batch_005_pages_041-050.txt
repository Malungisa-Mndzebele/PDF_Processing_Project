Cap, Gown
And What??

By Stanley Komito
Lafayette Legend

Four rebellious Sea Gate boys,
two of whom barely graduated,
were caught wearing dungarees and
Beatle Boots under their graduation
gowns. The graduation exercises
took place at a famous movie
theater in downtown Brooklyn.

One of the cocky boys remarked
“Eley what are they gonna fail me
now??”

2 Barely
Graduate

By Carl Ashby
‘Health Ed Joumal

After making a mockery of phys-ed
class for the majority of their senior
year, Coach Gary Lasker pulled
two teens from gym class 6 weeks
before graduation and gave them
the bad news: they weren’t going
to graduatel! Although the 2 boys
had virtually straight A’s in
academics, they were total losers
when it came to gym. They
pleaded with Mr. Lasker and asked
what they could do to make it up.
After thinking about a just
punishment, he required the
students to double time in every
gym class. They had to do twice
the exercise, twice the running, as
well as lead the class in exercise
until the end of the schoo! year.
Lasker also humiliated the boys in
front of each and every class, but
allowed them to graduate with a
grade of one point over the
minimum passing grade of 65.

Yellow Laundry
Mystery Solved

Read a Book-a-Day Club

An obese Sea Gate Cauily started
to notice that their laundry
mysteriously started turning yellow
every time they removed it from

the clothes line. Mrs. Bulla claims
she uses Clorox bleach in every
wash load, but the laundry
curiously turns yellow and has an
ammonia smell after it dries. This
happened for months until her son
Gerald started doing some detective
work on hisown. After 2 more
months of surveillance, Gerald
Bulla caught the culprit red (or
should I say yellow) handed. The
Bulla’s downstairs neighbor’s son
had been repeatedly squirting the
laundry with a squirt gun filled
with an unknown yellow liquid.
‘The Bullas were forced to move
away after more highjinks
occurred

5 Graders
Clean up
Coney

By Nelly Bly
Graves End Books

‘Mr, Stephen Levy whip-trained
his over-achieving class 5-3 until
they mastered Easy Steps March
and Aida, Only then would he
allow them to be featured in the
Prestigious Coney Island Clean Up
Campaign Parade. The long
awaited Parade arrived, and the
fifth graders had to march in
sweltering 110 degree heat. Fifteen
of the 45 kids suffered heat
exhaustion, and one saxophone
player continued marching and
playing until midnight. The Sea
Gate boy marched until his pinky
toe popped through the side of his
signature blue Keds boat sneakers.
He was awarded the “Schmuck of
the Coney Island Clean up

——————

Campaign“ award. Because of
the notoriety the student gave Keds,
they offered him a lifetime supply
of the sneakers, as long as those
were the only shoes he would ever
wear in the future. The same offer
came from a local sweatshirt
manufacturer, but they eventually
went out of business after giving
the kid so many free sweatshirts.
He still wears them today, but has
his kid brother silk screen different
logos on them such as “POLICE”,
“ZORRO” and “SHMITKA”

Teacher Almost
Gets the Boot

By Emil Suskind
PS. 188 News

Sixth grade teacher Ed
Goldsmith, was never known to be
a conventional thinker by his peers,
but his students really enjoyed his
‘non-conformism. With his dry wit
and different way of looking at
things, the students were always
‘educated, as well as entertained
His colleagues never respected
Goldsmith and probably resented
his odd approach.

On assembly day in April of
1964, Mr. Goldsmith, an
accomplished jazz pianist, played
the national anthem in a “jazzed-
up” version, and sent the
auditorium reeling into a near riot.
‘The teachers hated the rendition,
calling it a mockery and a disgrace,
while the children clapped and
snapped to the coolest version of
the anthem they’d ever heard!

On the next day, Mr. Goldsmith
was handed his walking papers by
the school administration, and
made an announcement to his class,
that he was forced to leave. The
{cont'd pg. 7, column 1)

--- Page 43 ---
students were dismayed, some to
the point of crying. When they
notified their parents of the
administration's decision, students
along with their parents went on
strike the following day. They
demanded a reversal of the
decision, stating that the teacher
was the one most influential
persons contributing to the
student’s creative thinking, After a
multi-hour standoff, the
administration backed down and
allowed Mr, Goldsmith to continue
teaching until the end of the term.
Ed Goldsmith stated that he would
not return to the school after that
year.

‘The kids really loved that man.

Math Teacher
Is Hung!!

By Paul Medici
Math Team Newslettor

Famed diminutive math teacher
Joseph “Mighty Joe” Rothman, has
been a fixture at Mark Twain JHS
for over 35 years, Students have
taunted the midget math man ever
since he started teaching. Year
after year of being teased by the
kids have caused the man to lash
‘out at new students before they
ever had the chance to bother him.
This year was different; when he
failed two students due to
personality conflicts, rather than
poor grades, the students held a
“lynching” right in the classroom
Mighty Joe was hung by his sport
coat, on a coat hook, in the
students’ wardrobe. Both students
were expelled from school and Mr.
Rothman only had his pride hurt.
To this day, Mighty Joe still
teaches math at age 112.

Near Drowning
in Chocolate

By Willy the Soda Jerk
Firestone Candy Papers

A brillo haired teenager was
nearly drowned in Fox’s U bet
chocolate syrup when his four
friends held him down and poured
10 jars of the thick, rich, velvety
egg cream component. After 5
minutes of the syrup torture, the
kinky teen suffered from terminal
acne and was immediately
ambulanced to Dr. Shin Ho Yep, @
pimple specialist. ‘The Dr. refused
treatment, as the acne was too far-

gone, “To much peempoo; cannot
fix”, the doctor, said. The crater-
face teen now has to check his oil
every 10 minutes, for fear of greasy
build-up. As punishment, his
friends were required to provide
him with a Jifetime supply of Oxy
10.

Near Miss on

Belt Pkwy.

By Officer Bits
Sea Gate Police Bulletin

Last Friday, 3 Sea Gate boys
perpetrated a hoax on popular math
tutor Richard “Dicky” Freed. One
boy set the scam up by mentioning
that he needed math tutoring,
knowing that Dicky would surely
zero in on this “needy student”.
Freed took the boy onto the Belt
Pkwy. in his navy blue 63 Chevy
Belair. Once they reached the large
gas tanks on the way to Sheepshead
Bay, two other boys who were
hiding behind the back seat popped
up and scared the dickens out of
Dicky. He temporarily lost control
of the vehicle when both arms went

off the steering wheel and up to the
roof of the vehicle as he shrieked in
fear. The 3 boys laughed
hysterically as Freed “s car
careened through 3 lanes of traffic,
almost flipping over the guard rail.
Police reported the incident to the
boys’ parents. The punishment: 2
boys- no color TV for One weck!!
The 3" boy was deprived of his
precious lobster salad for one week.
Freed returned to normal tutoring,
after # week of shoe polishing and
recuperation from the mental
trauma,

Fans wild over
Dynamite Tuna

By Chaim Gitler
‘Mermaid Ave. Gourmet

Every so often, a genius comes
along with a new recipe that takes
the world by storm. The genius
this time?... the son of a Coney
Jstand fireman, who worked for
months honing the magic recipe for
the perfect tuna salad. The entire
neighborhood waits on fine for
hours outside the fireman’s house,
for just one small taste of the
“miracle tuna”. Folks can’t believe
that the young lad had the wisdom
or knowledge to create such a
masterpiece in tuna.

When asked for the recipe, the
teen will only reveal one part of the
secret “It has to do with squeezing
the oil out of the tuna,

then rinsing it with water”, he said.
Sources also reported seeing used
Hellman’s mayo jars in the trash
cans behind the house. According
to national tuna experts, this could
be another major breakthrough in
solving the “miracle tuna” puzzle,.

The “tuna boy”, as he is now
known, commented: “Tf you like
my tuna, wait till you taste my
fantastic “Wonder Slaw” cole slaw,
and my soon-to-be famous Galliano
Milk Shake”.

Teen brings
home Brit

By Merton Boober
LN.A. Rescue Sheet

A cocky Coney Island teenager
met a genuine British Pachoochie
and had the audacity to bring her
home to live in his parent’s house.
His mother never trusted the
pachoochie and believed that she
insidiously sapped the intelligence
and manlihood from her son. After
months of monitoring and
recording observed data, the
mother supplied the LN.S. with all
the dope on this wild Englander
and had her deported. When the
boy regained his senses, he had
totally forgotten any details of the
British pachoochie.

Ejected from
Singles
Weekend

By Henny Youngman
Catskills Comics

Coney Island teens signed up for
what should have been a fun
singles weekend at Kutsher’s
Country Club, but something went
awry. After causing disturbance at
the pool, the young men went to
their room and made so much noise
that security had to come and warn
them of probable ejection from the
premises. Later on, the trouble-
makers arrived at the main
ballroom for dinner. Each table
was matched with boys and girls
for the event. Again, the boys were
causing more trouble, and by the
time the food was served, the
crowning blow occurred. One of
the teens known as. “Neutral”,
started eating directly out of the
large salad serving bowl. To make
things worse, he ate without knife
or fork, much like a mad dog. He
was actually foaming at the mouth,
growling, and jerking his head up
and down as he chewed the salad
Needless to say, the boys were
immediately escorted from the
ballroom, and promptly told to
leave Kutcher’s without delay.
