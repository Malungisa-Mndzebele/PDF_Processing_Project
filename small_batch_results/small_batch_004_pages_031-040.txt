SEA GATE
CHRONICLE

Accordion
Torture

By Robert Wolfe
Sea Gate Gazette

‘A Sea Gate boy was forced by
his mother to play “Flight of the
Bumble bee” and “Saber Dance”
on his squeeze box, 100 times a
day for 5 years. By the time the
lad became proficient, he was
able to play the tunes 100 times
in 10 minutes. Firemen from the
318 Hook and Ladder Division
were always called in for his
daily recital, in order to douse the
flames if the boy’s fingers caught
fire from his dervish-like
playing.

‘Months later, the musical
lad’s mom, again forced the boy
against his will, to perfor the
two pieces at Carnegie Hall in
front of thousands attending. She

ed

threatened to withhold his
treasured Nathan’s lobster salad,
if he refused to perform
perfectly. He performed once
again, and was treated to a one-
pound container of his favorite
delicacy.

Seafood Diet??

Coney Island Health officials
reported today, that a boy
survived the first 13 years of his
life eating only Nathan’s Lobster
Salad and drinking Sunny Boy

specifically went to the beach to
buy the Sunny Boys complete
with conical wax coated
containers and the metal ring at
the mouth. She claimed the
metal ring gave her son bigger
lips for playing saxophone and
‘bassoon; and the lobster salad,
she believed would make her son
agenius. The mother was
committed to an insane asylum in
Florida, and the boy believes he
fas 2 jets, an island, a ranch,
mansions and a sexy English
socialite girlfriend.

After the boy was taken into
custody by officials and fed lox,
bagels and cream cheese, the
hallucinations disappeared. He
was given a % length black
leather coat and returned to his
daily activities of providing free
joe cream and candy to his
friends (courtesy of Jack’s

Beach Attack

By Lawrence Dyck
‘Sea Gate Observer

Lloyd Bridges “Human Fish”,
water monger, and a local t-
shirt clad Hippo were attacked by
‘school of deadly Coney Island
Whitefish, The attack occurred
last Saturday just off the Sea
Gate Cabanas at Beach One. The
enraged Hippo then clammed
indiscriminately, and repeatedly
on the chests and faces of the
other victims. The “Human
Fish”, and the water monger also
reported a curious yellow warmth
in the seawater when they came
close to the Hippo. The
swimmers thanked the Hippo for

throwing a fit and clamming, as
it scared the schoo! of whitefish
off. All beaches are flying a
Coney Island Whitefish warning
flag for the remainder of the
swimming season.

Nickel Artist
Arrested

By Lilian Fisher
Handicap Times Magazine

Coney Island's Melvin
Fromholder was best known as
“Mad Mel” the nickel carver.
Mel had the uncanny ability to
cut everything off a buffalo
nickel, leaving only the buffalo
and the “ring” surrounding it.
Customers would travel from all
5 boroughs and wait months to
buy one of the hard-to-get coins,
A local wisecracker named
Larry-John Streitman, tried to
pump Mel for information on
how to mass-produce these coins.
Fromholder was insulted and
became enraged. Mad Mel lived
up to his name when he stabbed
Streitman in the “Stomach and
the Leg” 10 times. Ironically,
Streitman was wearing a cheap
copy of Mel’s original “No
Hassle Band” on his wrist when
he was attacked. “If it wasn’t for
the “No Hassle Band”, said
Streitman, “1 woulda been
dead”.

Fromholder is doing hard
time, and can’t fill customer’s
orders for the nickels because
officials refused to let Mel have
his tools. You'd better get in
linc; Mad Mel’s in for 5 years
and he’s got 5125 orders for the
prized buffalo nickels.

Dermatologis
Fights Fire

By Robert Ardigo
Pizza Face Pages

World renowned Pimple
Expert Dr. Shin Ho Yep claims
the secret to a great complexion
is in his secret formula.

‘Hundreds of butter face teens
flock to Dr. Yep’s office off
Ocean Pkwy. in Brooklyn to
obtain much needed help. The
Dr. applies his “secret formula”
to kid’s faces and within seconds
their skin feels like a raging,
inferno. Some patients wail in
agony from the fiery concoction,
and if they scream loud enough,
Yep says “just 10 more minutes”.
if they start to cry, Dr. Yep
proclaims “OK we put out fire
now”, He takes a tissue and puts
2 drops of water on it and barely
dabs at the blistering skin,
Chemical analysis of Yep’s
“secret formula” found it to be
nothing but a combination of
straight hydrochloric and sulfuric
acids.

The results: a cranberry sauce
red appearance immediately after
treatment, but after two weeks,
all but one kinicy haired Sea Gate
boy , had a peaches and cream
complexion.
